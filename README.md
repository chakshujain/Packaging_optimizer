# Packaging_optimizer
This software produces best optimized designs for your packaging boxes. 
Suppose you want to pack 38 boxes but you have a  box with a capacity of 40.
This will not only lead to wastage of cardboard used in making boxes but also , the spaces left in between the small boxes will lead to the breaking of fragile items like biscuits, glass bottles etc. 
So, I have designed an efficient way to pack any kind of stuff.
Give it the dimensions no. of units of the small boxes you want to pack and it will make the best designs for you.

It will use three.js and cannon.js libraries of javascript so make sure you add their scripts correctly.

Simply, copy the whole directory and run "itc.html"

You will need unity(3-D) gamin software to run real-time simulation. So install unity if you wanna see that.
